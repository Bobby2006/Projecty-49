        <p> For the initial 1500 years or so of its existence, origami was actually known as orikata, a Japanese word that translates to “folded paper”. </p>
        <p> Paper was originally created sometime around 100 A.D. While paper is considered a common and cheap commodity now, at the time of its conception, the resources required to create paper were not as easily available. </p>
        <p> Origami Butterflies and other simple designs are often given along with gifts and paper wrapping, at most Wedding Rituals but most the important is the presentation of 1000 paper cranes. </p>
        <p> The first book ever published about origami was entitled “Sembazuru Orikata” (Thousand Crane Folding), written by Akisato Rito, which was about the timeless custom of folding a 1000 paper cranes for traditional weddings and the wishes it could grant. </p>
        <p> As a good luck token for all the future dangers to be faced, samurais commonly used to present gifts of origami to each other. These gifts were usually a type of ceremonial origami, folded from multiple pieces of paper into intricate shapes and presented along with a strip of dried fish or meat, to signify “good wishes”. </p>
